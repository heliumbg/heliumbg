<p>Once set up and connected to the internet, there are 5 ways your hotspot earns (with no additional work from you!):</p>



<ul><li>When a device sends information over the network using your hotspot</li><li>By initiating PoC Challenges over the internet</li><li>By participating in a PoC Challenge</li><li>By acting as a Witness to a PoC Challenge between nearby hotspots.</li><li>Being a part of a Consensus Group</li></ul>
